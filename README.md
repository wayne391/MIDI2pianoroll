## Functions

### midi

Codes here are modified from [pretty_midi](https://github.com/craffel/pretty-midi). To obtain the midi information faithfully, I choose to preserve the original design of time (symbolic, ticks per beat).

The same as pretty_midi, the parser wraps midi events into containers. Delta timing is transformed into absolute timing. Finally, if one track with multiple channel and program number, they will be splitted into individual tracks.


### pianoroll

* Piano roll (pitch number & downbeat)
